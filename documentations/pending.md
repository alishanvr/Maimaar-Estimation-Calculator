Production Deployment — CORS lockdown, HTTPS enforcement, Sanctum token expiry, MySQL config, .env.production, queue worker setup.

Branding & PDF Polish — Company logo in PDF headers, letterhead styling, custom fonts for the generated BOQ/JAF PDFs.

User Experience Polish — Estimation duplication/clone, version history/revision tracking, estimation comparison, bulk export.

Dashboard Enhancements — Charts over time (estimations per week/month), user activity heatmap, estimation value trends.

Data Import/Export — Import estimation data from Excel, export all estimation data as CSV/Excel.
